# imaba-update

my very first web project as a part of Media BEM Fasilkom UI 2017's project. iMaba is a guide especially for new students to know every part of their new faculty.
used HTML and CSS (mostly used W3.CSS framework).
the files are not in a good order because this is my very first time using git.

take a look at bem.cs.ui.ac.id/imaba
